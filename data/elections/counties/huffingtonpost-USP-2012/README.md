# 2012 Presidential Election Results

The Huffington Post collected county-level election results from the websites of the election authority in each state, parsed the data and converted them into a common format.

The resulting comma-separated-values files can be found in the `/data` directory.

The unprocessed source data for each state can be found in the `/sources` directory. That directory also contains a `sources.csv` file, which lists the URL from which each results file was downloaded.

The repository includes county-level results for 49 states, precinct-level results for Alaska and the citywide totals for the District of Columbia. It also includes town-level results for Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
